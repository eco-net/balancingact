        <strong>Sustainable  Development</strong><strong> </strong></p>
      <p align="left">In the conference on Environment and  Development held by the UN in Rio de    Janeiro 1992 it was agreed by all countries to form a  sustainable development for 21st century named Agenda 21. In this it was stated  that education is essential to further a sustainable development and to improve  peoples ability to solve environmental and development problems.</p>
      <p align="left">Ten years later, in 2002, a UN World Summit  Meeting took place in Johannesburg  in which status was stated over the progress of sustainability of each country.  In the meeting it was realized that education is one of the most important  tools in the work for a sustainable world. Subsequently UN adopted a resolution  to speed up the process of Education for Sustainable Development covering the  next decade 2005-2014.</p>
      <p align="left">The UN organisation, UNESCO, is the  coordinator of the project for the period 2005-2014. The responsibility for  carrying out the work lies within the UNESCO National Commission in each  country.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>UNESCO&rsquo;S  vision for the decade:</strong> <br />
          <em>&ldquo;A world in  which all people have a possibility of getting education and learn the values,  behaviour and way of living that support a sustainable future and a positive  development of society.&rdquo;</em> </p>
