      <p align="left"><em>The project is  based on seven values of sustainable development and education for sustainable  development, which the participating institutions support as a base for their  work:</em> </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>1</strong>&nbsp;We recognize the important consideration for  the coming generation and in that respect we will estimate the consequences of  our actions and doings in a long-term perspective.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>2</strong> We recognize that there is only one Earth;  with limited resources and capacity and therefore we must give the highest  priority to environment and resources.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>3</strong> We recognize that we live in a world with  unequal distribution, and because of that it is our moral duty to work for a  more equalized distribution of the resources and wealth.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>4</strong> We acknowledge that everyone must participate  in solving the global challenges and are willing to contribute and work to  strengthen the democracy on all levels. </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>5</strong> We shall find new knowledge to solve problems  across technical boundaries and we shall educate people to participate in  global citizenship with focus on environmental and social issues.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>6</strong> We shall show the connection between words  and action by working according to the principles of sustainability on a daily  basis.We shall contribute to a widespread political debate  on sustainability and be visible in this debate in society &ndash; we shall work out  the values for every step forward to ease the way to a sustainable practise.</p>
